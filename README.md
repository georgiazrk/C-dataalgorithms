# C#dataalgorithms
Assignment for Data Structures and Algorithms paper, second year Bachelor of Applied Information Technology.

This assignment spanned the length of the Data Structures and Algorithms paper in my Bachelors degree. We were given weekly tasks that involved programming in C# using Visual Studio. Practice in Big O Analysis, singly and doubly linked lists, stack and queue abstract data types, binary search trees, sorting and searching algorithms like binary search, bubble sort and quick sort, hash tables, B-Trees and AVL trees.

Practice in:
- Big O Analysis
- Arrays and simple algorithms
- Singly and doubly linked lists
- Stack and queues abstract data types
- Use of data structures in modular programming
- Binary search trees
- Sorting and searching algorithms e.g. binary search, bubble sort, quick sort, or heap sort
- Hash tables
  - Insert, delete and search operations
- Balanced Trees; B-Trees and AVL Trees
